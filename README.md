Tesla Light Show (xLights)



The **main** branch of this repository is a base xLights project. For you to use as the template xLights project to make Tesla light shows with. 

Suggested development workflow (to create a new light show):
- while on the **main** branch, create a new development branch with whatever name you want (I suggest the name of the song you're going to use)
- in this new development branch, open xLights, and  open this repository directory
- save changes you make to your development branch by committing said changes
- to make another new light show, start from step one above

Once you've created a Tesla light show, I suggest you upload a sample video of the light show to YouTube, and then upload your light show files to https://teslalightshare.io

For more information about how to create a Tesla light show using xLights, see the official Tesla repository -> https://github.com/teslamotors/light-show
